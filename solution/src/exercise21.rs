// Topic: Result & the question mark operator
//
// Summary:
//   This small program simulates unlocking a door using digital keycards
//   backed by a database. Many errors can occur when working with a database,
//   making the question mark operator the perfect thing to use to keep
//   the code managable.
//
// Requirements:
// * Write the body of the `authorize` function. The steps to authorize a user
//   are:
//     1. Connect to the database
//     2. Find the employee with the `find_employee` database function
//     3. Get a keycard with the `get_keycard` database function
//     4. Determine if the keycard's `access_level` is sufficient, using the
//        `required_access_level` function implemented on `ProtectedLocation`.
//        * Higher `access_level` values grant more access to `ProtectedLocations`.
//          1000 can access 1000 and lower. 800 can access 500 but not 1000, ...
// * Run the program after writing your `authorize` function. Expected output:
//     Ok(Allow)
//     Ok(Deny)
//     Err("Catherine doesn't have a keycard")
// * Use the question mark operator within the `authorize` function.
//
// Notes:
// * Only the `authorize` function should be changed. Everything else can remain
//   unmodified.
